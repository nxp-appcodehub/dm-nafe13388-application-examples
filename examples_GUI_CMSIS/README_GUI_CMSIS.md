#### 4.3 Current sensing <a name="current-sensing"></a>

- <p align="justify"> Current sensing in the NAFE13388 works by using a small, precise resistor to measure how much current is flowing in a system. It converts the current into a voltage that the device can read. This method is accurate, reduces noise, and is commonly used for monitoring things like pressure in industrial systems. </p>

- <p align="justify"> The NAFE13388 measures pressure using a pressure transmitter that converts pressure into a standard current signal, typically ranging from 4 mA to 20 mA. For example, 4 mA might represent 0 pressure, and 20 mA could represent maximum pressure (for example 10 bars). The device reads the current through a precise resistor, converts it to a voltage, and then calculates the corresponding pressure based on the current value. This allows the system to accurately track changes in pressure. </p>

- Provide voltage to analog input AI4P-AI4N using a power supply.
- Connect resistance in series with voltage on AI4P-AI4N to measure current across AI4P-AI4N.
- Refer this table to set voltage and corresponding gains based on resistances used:

- Reading voltage across 2-wire RTD powered by NAFE13388 VIEX using SCCR.
- RTD stands for resistance temperature detectors.
- <p align="justify"> A 2-wire RTD measures temperature by passing a current through a resistor that changes resistance with temperature. The voltage across the RTD is measured to calculate the resistance. In this setup, wire resistance can affect accuracy, making it best for short distances. </p>
- <p align="justify"> The main drawback of a 2-wire RTD is reduced accuracy due to added resistance from the wires, affecting measurements. </p>

- Connect one red wire of the RTD to AI2P and one white wire to AICOM which completes the current forcing path required to force 750 uA current to RTD.
- Connect other red wire of the RTD to AI1P and other white wire to AI1N which is the differential voltage sensing path that is then used to calculate temperature according to the conversion formulae.
- <p align="justify"> Measure current across AI2P-AICOM by connecting any wire or resistance on AI1P, Place red probe of multimeter on AI2P on which wire/resistance is connected and black probe to AICOM which is J91 on NAFE13388. </p>

- **Note:** A 4-wire RTD is better because it eliminates the influence of lead wire resistance, providing more accurate temperature measurements. The difference of around 3°C between 2-wire and 4-wire RTDs arises because the 2-wire setup includes lead resistance in the measurement, causing higher temperature errors.

#### 4.7 Weight scale <a name="weight-scale"></a>

- <p align="justify">  <b> Weight scale (load cell): </b> Calibration and reading procedure of a load cell, the load cell excitation is generated by the NAFE integrated VIEX, the conversion is performed using single channel continuous readings conversion. </p>

- <p align="justify">A load cell is a transductor used to translate mechanical force, such as weight, into measurable quantity. Load cells are usually composed of a strain gauge positioned on an elastic element. The elastic element is usually made of steel, so it is strong, but also has some elasticity. The minute variations on the spring element can be detected with strain gauges. The strain of the strain gauge is then converted by the electronics (ADC + excitation circuit) to determine the weight. </p>

- <p align="justify"> In a load cell, a wheatstone bridge structure is used to transform a resistance value to a voltage value. The wheatstone architecture utilizes a strain gauge in place of resistors. AI2P of the NAFE is used as output voltage, while AI1P and AI1N are used to sense the voltage across the bridge. </p>

     [<img src="./../images/loadCell_wheatstoneBridge.PNG" width="700"/>](loadCell_wheatstoneBridge.PNG)

- <p align="justify"> This application needs a voltage excitation source and two input channels to sense the voltage. Use a slow data rate and a higher gain configuration to improve the quality of reading as the sense voltage range will be in the order of mV. </p>

- Connections guide for weighing scale:

    - <p align="justify"> Connect red and black wires of the load cell to AI2P and AICOM respectively for forcing 6 volts excitation voltage to AI2P. </p>
    - <p align="justify"> Connect AI1P-AI1N with green and white wires respectively to sense differential voltage acrross which is required for weight calculation. </p>

- <p align="justify"> **Need of 6 V excitation voltage:** A 6 V excitation voltage is required for a load cell to provide a stable and consistent voltage to the strain gauges. This excitation voltage powers the strain gauges and ensures that any changes in their resistance due to applied force result in measurable voltage changes. Higher excitation voltage, like 6 V, improves the signal-to-noise ratio, enhancing the accuracy and resolution of the weight measurement. It also ensures the strain gauges operate within their optimal range for precise and reliable performance. </p>

- Three-step process to calibrate and measure weight of any object:
   
    1. Offset calculation: Firstly, sense the voltage across load cell without putting any weight, resulting voltage should be stored as offset.
    2. Calibration coefficient calculation: Calibrate the load cell with known weight and store the value of calibration coefficient as follows:

        - calibrationCoeff = (knownWeight)/(ConversionResult-Offset)
    3. Now any weight can be measured, by voltage conversion read by the ADC (Vadc):
        
        - Weight = calibrationCoeff * (Vadc - Offset)

- Step 1: Offset calculation (without any weight):

    - Click on the **Calibration** button to perform offset reset.

        [<img src="./../images/Cal_Button.png" width="700"/>](Cal_Button.png)

    - Click **Measure** in step 1 to perform offset reset.

- Step 2: Calculation of calibration coefficient by calibrating the weight scale with known weight (303g in this case):

    - Perform the calibration in Step 2 of the Calibration tab to calculate the calibration coefficient by adding any known weight.
