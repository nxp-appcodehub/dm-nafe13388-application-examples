Hardware requirements
===================
- Mini/micro C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- NAFE13388-UIM board
- Personal Computer

Hardware settings

The needed hardware are:

Power supply of 15 V or 15 V Adapter.
USB cable.
Jumper wires
FRDM-MCXN947 Base Board
NAFE13388-UIM Shield Board (analog front-end)
4-wire RTD Sensor ( RTD 2/4-wire applications).
220 ohm resistor (current sensing application).
Load cell (weight-scale application).
External power supply in order to try different voltage readings (voltage-sensing application).

Hardware connections details:

SGM3209YS8G/TR IC U20 (J90 1x2) The SGM3209 is a charge pump voltage converter which is used to generate a negative supply from a positive input. J90(1*2). It generates -15 V when we apply +15 V using external voltage source.

JUMPER (default) = CLOSED
OUTPUT pin of IC U20
-15 V
AICOM - J91 (CLOSED)

Analog inputs: For analog inputs use jumpers J82 and J83.

External voltage source -> J89 1- GND 2- +15 V

Settings for selection of EDMA/Interrupt Mode:

Note: Set RTE_SPI1_DMA_EN to 1 for EDMA mode and RTE_SPI1_DMA_EN to 0 for Interrupt mode in board/RTE_Device.h

Prepare the Firmware
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Right click on the project and select build to start building the project.
3.  Click on debug to flash the firmware on FRDM-MCXN947.
